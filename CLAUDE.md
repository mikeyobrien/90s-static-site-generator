# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a documentation repository for storing markdown (.md) files. All documentation should be organized and maintained in markdown format.

## File Organization

- Create descriptive filenames that clearly indicate the content
- Use lowercase with hyphens for file names (e.g., `project-setup.md`, `api-reference.md`)
- Group related documentation in subdirectories when appropriate

## Markdown Guidelines

- Use proper markdown syntax for formatting
- Include a clear title (H1) at the start of each document
- Structure content with appropriate heading levels (H2, H3, etc.)
- Use code blocks with language specification for code examples

## Common Tasks

When asked to create or update documentation:
1. Check if a similar document already exists before creating a new one
2. Maintain consistent formatting across all documents
3. Ensure all links are relative and functional within the repository
