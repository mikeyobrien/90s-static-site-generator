# 🌐 Retro-SSG: 90s Static Site Generator

Welcome to the information superhighway! Retro-SSG is a minimalist static site generator that brings back the nostalgic charm of 90s web design while leveraging modern web technologies.

## 🚀 Features (Planned)

- **Hugo-like CLI interface** - Familiar commands for easy adoption
- **Full Markdown support** - Write content in modern Markdown
- **Authentic 90s themes** - Tiled backgrounds, "Under Construction" GIFs, and more!
- **Fast builds** - Minimal dependencies for quick generation
- **Live development server** - See changes instantly
- **No JavaScript required** - Pure HTML/CSS output for that authentic feel

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mikeyobrien/90s-static-site-generator.git
cd 90s-static-site-generator

# Install globally (once npm packaging is ready)
npm install -g retro-ssg

# Or run locally
npm link
```

## 🎮 Usage

### Create a New Site
```bash
retro-ssg new my-awesome-site
cd my-awesome-site
```

### Build Your Site
```bash
# Build your site from markdown files
retro-ssg build

# Your site will be generated in the 'output' directory
```

The build command will:
- Process all Markdown files in `content/posts/` and `content/pages/`
- Parse YAML front matter for metadata
- Convert Markdown to HTML
- Apply the retro 90s theme
- Copy static assets from `content/assets/`

### Start Development Server
```bash
retro-ssg server
```

## 📝 Content Structure

Create your content using Markdown with YAML front matter:

```markdown
---
title: My Awesome Post
date: 1997-03-15
author: WebMaster
tags: [web, technology, nostalgia]
---

# Welcome to my post!

This is written in **Markdown** but will be rendered with 90s style!
```
