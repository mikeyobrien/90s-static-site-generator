# About This Blog

This is a personal blog focused on technology, web development, and digital culture. It's intentionally simple, using a minimal 90s aesthetic that prioritizes readability and fast loading times.

## About Me

I'm a web developer who misses the simplicity of the early web. I believe in:

- Writing HTML by hand
- Keeping JavaScript to a minimum
- Respecting user privacy
- Making content accessible to everyone
- Building sites's that load quickly on any connection

## Why the 90s Theme?

The early web was built on principles of openness, simplicity, and user empowerment. This theme is my small way of honoring those principles while still providing a modern reading experience.

## Technical Details

This site is built with:
- Static HTML generated from Markdown
- Minimal CSS with dark mode support
- A tiny bit of JavaScript for the theme toggle
- No tracking, no analytics, no cookies (except for theme preference)

## Contact

Feel free to reach out via email if you'd like to discuss any of the topics I write about. I enjoy thoughtful correspondence and try to reply to every message, though it might take a few days.

## RSS Feed

If you'd like to follow this blog, there will be an RSS feed available soon. RSS is another wonderful technology from the early web that still works perfectly today.
