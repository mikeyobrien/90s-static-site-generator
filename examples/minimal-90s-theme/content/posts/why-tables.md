# Why I Use Tables for Layout

If you view the source of this page, you'll notice something that might make modern web developers cringe: I'm using HTML tables for layout. This is a deliberate choice, and I'd like to explain why.

## Authenticity Matters

This blog uses a 90s-inspired theme, and in the 90s, tables were *the* way to create layouts. CSS was in its infancy, and browser support was inconsistent at best. Tables provided a reliable way to create multi-column layouts that worked across different browsers.

## Simplicity Has Value

Modern CSS is powerful but complex. Grid, Flexbox, custom properties - they're all wonderful tools, but they add layers of abstraction. Sometimes, a simple table is all you need. The entire layout of this site is defined in less than 50 lines of HTML.

## It Still Works

Here's the thing: table-based layouts still work perfectly fine for simple sites. They're semantic (when used for tabular data), accessible (screen readers handle them well), and universally supported. For a blog that prioritizes content over flashy design, they're more than adequate.

## Constraints Foster Creativity

Working within the constraints of 90s web technology forces me to focus on what really matters: the content. I can't hide behind fancy animations or complex layouts. Every design decision has to be intentional and serve the reader.

## A Small Act of Rebellion

In a world of 5MB JavaScript bundles and CSS-in-JS, using tables for layout feels like a small act of rebellion. It's a reminder that the web doesn't have to be complicated to be effective.

So yes, this site uses tables for layout, and I'm not ashamed of it. Sometimes the old ways are still good ways.
